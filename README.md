# Banking_System
This is my first project for SpringBoard. This is a simple project that lets you create an account, deposit money, and see customer details
This project will start of by asking the customer to either login or create a new account
if customer already have an account they will be able to login 
if customer does not, he/she will be able to create an account. 
Once logged in customer will be able to see the details of its account 
If creating a new account customer will be able to open a new account, deposit money and see the balance
